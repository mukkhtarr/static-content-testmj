<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is revoking the licenses of K.U.S.H. Collective (CDPH-10003907 and C11-0000695-LIC) located at 16770 Stagg Street, Van Nuys, CA 91460. During its investigation, the DCC found that the licensee was unable to demonstrate that cannabis products represented as having been manufactured on the licensee’s premises were in fact cultivated, processed, manufactured, packed, or held in a location duly licensed as required by California’s adult use cannabis law (“MAUCRSA”). The Department has probable cause to believe the products subject to the embargo may be adulterated or misbranded and therefore, may pose a risk to cannabis consumers. </p>
