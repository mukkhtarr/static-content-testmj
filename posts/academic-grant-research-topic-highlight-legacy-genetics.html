<p>In April 2023, DCC awarded $20M in grants to 16 of California’s academic research institutions to support cannabis-related scientific research and studies on topics important to California consumers, businesses, and policy makers. Studies include medicinal use of cannabis, legacy genetics, the impact of cannabis on the mental health of young people, and novel cannabinoids like Delta-8 and Delta-10 THC.&nbsp;<br><br>Cal Poly Humboldt was awarded over $2.5 million for a &nbsp;study that will identify, document, and help preserve the history, value, and diversity of California’s legacy cannabis genetics and the communities that steward them.&nbsp;<br><br>“There&#8217;s a wealth of talent and genetic resources embedded really across the state and in every community. We hope this provides a model for further research and that this project is something that can be built upon over time.” states Genine Coleman, Executive Director of Origins Council. “This study will integrate the diversity of California’s cannabis history from north to south, including the Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) community and social equity entrepreneurs in our urban areas.&nbsp;<br><br>A primary objective of this research is to amplify the voice of the legacy cannabis community and empower them to quantify the value of their contributions to the biodiversity and innovation of cannabis genetics in California.&nbsp;<br><br>“It&#8217;s about the plants and the cultivars that sustained particular communities. We want to be able to get those stories as they are imagined by those communities,” states Dominic Corva, program leader of the Cannabis Studies major at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. “It’s about more than just the breeding.”&nbsp;<br><br>To learn more, take a moment to watch The Legacy of Big Sur Cannabis, or visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legacycannabis.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">www.legacycannabis.org</a>. A portion of the revenue collected from cannabis taxes funds is dedicated to academic research. These grants fall into several categories, including:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Expanding our knowledge about cannabis&nbsp;</li>

<li>Studying the effects of adult-use cannabis legalization&nbsp;</li>

<li>Helping local governments establish cannabis retail licensing programs</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also funding opportunities from other state agencies.
