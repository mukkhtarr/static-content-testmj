<p>Cultivators who previously obtained a mixed-light Tier 1 license and use no artificial light may request to change their license type to Outdoor cultivation and receive the corresponding reduction in license fee.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>To be eligible:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your current license must be mixed-light Tier 1; &nbsp;</li>

<li>Your current premises and/or lighting diagram must not include use of artificial lighting; and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Your licensed canopy size must remain the same.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To request this one-time change,</strong>&nbsp;the designated responsible party or owner must submit a request to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:licensechange@cannabis.ca.gov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">licensechange@cannabis.ca.gov</a>&nbsp;that includes the following information:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Indication the request is for a “license type change from mixed-light Tier 1 to Outdoor cultivation”&nbsp;</li>

<li>License number&nbsp;</li>

<li>Expiration date&nbsp;</li>

<li>Legal business name of licensee</li>
</ul>

<p>Licensees should submit their request for a license type change prior to submitting their renewal. If a current license is eligible for a license type change, the license will be renewed with the new license type and the renewal fee will be recalculated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have already renewed your license or submitted your renewal request, you can still submit a license change request by following the instructions above. If eligible, DCC will refund the difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Requests must be submitted by November 6, 2023.&nbsp;</strong></p>
