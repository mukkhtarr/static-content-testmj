<p>Jurisdiction: Los Angeles</p>

<p>“I’m a firm believer in a social, entrepreneurial approach to addressing health and safety issues in California. We wanted to service senior citizens, people of color and bring equity into our communities.”</p>

<p>Carrie Broadus is the owner of Pot Luck Enterprises in Los Angeles, a non-storefront retailer. Broadus took advantage of Los Angeles’ technical assistance program to learn how to navigate the local permitting process and form a locally verified equity business. Broadus now uses the knowledge gained from the technical assistance program to assist other applicants through the licensing process and advocate for cannabis equity in her community.</p>

<p>Los Angeles’&nbsp;Business, Licensing and Compliance Assistance Program&nbsp;for equity applicants offers digital classes featuring real-world cannabis industry examples. Programming is delivered through an accessible learning management system, allowing the city to track participation and course popularity. Courses are updated and new content is added as needed.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“This is about technology and making sure people have the opportunity to access the information at their leisure. And it’s entertaining!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The program contains over 90 hours of course content and over 300 hours of coaching with subject-matter-experts. Topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li>State and local licensing requirements</li>

<li>Cannabis specific business development</li>

<li>Workforce development</li>

<li>Marketing</li>

<li>Supply chain strategy</li>

<li>Commercial lease negotiation</li>

<li>Regulation Compliance&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>One-on-one video coaching is also available for applicants to get specific answers on unique questions affecting their business.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The city was very thorough in explaining the criteria for the program. Managing my expectations was very important.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where other technical assistance programs have faced challenges that include limited funding a lack of cannabis-related experience among instructors, or a lack of awareness among equity program participants, Los Angeles has overcome these challenges. Their model offers a promising practice for other jurisdictions in the state.</p>
