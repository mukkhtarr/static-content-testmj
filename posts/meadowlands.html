<p>On Friday, September 29, 2023, DCC Director, Nicole Elliott, and Deputy Director of Compliance, Jeff Merriman, traveled to Mendocino County to engage with licensees and industry leaders at Meadowlands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the event, Director Elliott participated in a keynote interview with Meadow’s CEO and Co-Founder, David Hua, that touched on several important issues including hemp, federal cannabis rescheduling, compliance, enforcement, and legislative bills that were pending the Governor’s action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director Elliott also joined the local regulator panel which held a discussion on the need to expand consumer access to cannabis, addressing the illegal cannabis market, and more.</p>

<p>While in Mendocino County, Director Elliott had the opportunity to tour the Bohemian Chemist’s operation and learn more about their story and the practices they use to develop their brand, their products, and their support of the legal industry.</p>

<p>“It is so fulfilling to connect with licensees under the majestic redwoods, have honest and open conversations, and learn more about the current issues they are facing,” stated Director Elliott. “The legacy cultivator and craft cannabis communities are the heartbeat of California Cannabis, and we have a lot to learn from one another. Aside from sharing the magnificent beauty of their plants, many of which are easily twice my height, I deeply appreciate their willingness to join me in a productive conversation – one where we could speak frankly about some of the challenges faced by licensees and the Department. As always, this willingness to share, listen, and engage in constructive dialogue is essential as we work to build the future of California’s cannabis industry.” </p>
