<p>It has been widely reported that the U.S. Secretary of Human Health and Services has recommended that cannabis (or, as federal law calls it, “marijuana”) be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III of the federal Controlled Substances Act. It remains to be seen what action the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) will take in response to this recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rescheduling would represent a historic shift in the federal government’s cannabis policy, and moving cannabis to Schedule III would have significant tax benefits for cannabis businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, rescheduling will not legalize state-licensed cannabis businesses as a matter of federal law, nor would it replace states’ existing regulatory frameworks. Irrespective of what the DEA does next, California’s state-regulated cannabis market will continue its work in advancing and facilitating a well-regulated, legal market that benefits all Californians. &nbsp;</p>
