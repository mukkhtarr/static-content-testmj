<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>

<p>On October 17, 2024, the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), as Lead Agency, certified the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Licensing of Commercial Cannabis Cultivation in Mendocino County Project (Project). The DCC currently issues commercial cannabis cultivation licenses under Division 10 of the Business and Professions Code and California Code of Regulations, title 4, division 19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All legal commercial cannabis activity must be conducted pursuant to state licensing requirements. As of the April 2023, there are 623 provisionally licensed commercial cannabis cultivation sites, 23 of which have associated cannabis distribution transport-only operations, within the unincorporated areas of Mendocino County that may operate under the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act while they actively and diligently purse all requirements for annual licensure. The EIR programmatically evaluates the impacts of the DCCâ€™s annual licensing of such provisionally licensed commercial cannabis operations in the County, as well as the environmental impacts of future licensed commercial cannabis operations.</p>
