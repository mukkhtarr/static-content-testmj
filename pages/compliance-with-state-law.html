<p>A vibrant, compliant legal cannabis market benefits and protects the safety of all Californians. DCC compliance efforts support this by:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Licensing locations that meet state requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Educating licensees about their responsibilities under their state licenses&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Routine inspections of licensed premises and their records&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Investigations of alleged violations of commercial cannabis laws &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>DCC works with licensees to gain voluntary compliance.. For example, DCC may issue a Notice to Comply, which identifies violations, provides direction as to how to correct the violations, and provides a deadline for correcting them. Serious violations or recurring violations may also be addressed by:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Denying an application for commercial cannabis licensure&nbsp;</li>

<li>Issuing a citation that may include: 
<ul>
<li>Fine – up to $5,000 per violation (licensed person) or $30,000 per violation (unlicensed person) </li>

<li>Order of abatement&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Suspending a license for a period of time&nbsp;</li>

<li>Revoking a license&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Imposing a fine based on the disciplinary guidelines </li>
</ul>
