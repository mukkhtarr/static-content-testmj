<p>Cannabis is a Schedule I drug, which means there are strict rules for studying it in the United States. As a result, we do not know as much as we would like about cannabis’s effects on the body.</p>

<p>Some of the revenue collected from cannabis taxes funds grants. This helps expand our knowledge about cannabis.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research funded by California</h2>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) <a href="/about-us/grant-funding/cannabis-academic-research-grants/">funds scientific research</a> to study the effects of adult-use cannabis legalization. This includes research about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Public health</li>

<li>Criminal justice and public safety</li>

<li>Economic impacts</li>

<li>Environmental impacts</li>

<li>Cannabis industry</li>
</ul>
