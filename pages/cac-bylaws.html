<p>On September 8, 2022, the CAC adopted a set of bylaws which outline the organization and structure of the committee and its subcommittees, including guidelines for conducting both committee and subcommittee meetings. </p>

        <li>Organization of the Committee</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                    <li>At the first meeting of each calendar year, the Cannabis Advisory Committee (CAC) shall elect
                        from its members a Chair and a Vice Chair to hold office for that calendar year. If the first
                        meeting of the calendar year is held after July 1, the Chair and Vice Chair shall also serve the
                        following calendar year. The Chair and Vice Chair can be reelected by the members to serve
                        additional terms.</li>
                    <li>If an office becomes vacant during the year, an election shall be held at the next meeting. The
                        newly elected officer(s) shall then serve the remainder of the term.</li>

                        upon the adoption of these bylaws:
