<p>The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) Licensing Division will issue a deficiency notification(s) if it is determined that your application requires additional information. Once the main application, all owner applications, the Declarations and Final Affidavit, and the application fee are submitted, the DCC will review the entirety for deficiencies.</p>

<p>A deficiency can be found in the main application, or in one or more Owner applications. Examples of deficiencies in the business’s main application may include missing or incorrect:</p>

<ul>
<li>CEQA compliance documentation</li>

<li>Documentation for your business entity – seller’s permit, Secretary of State documents, surety bond, list of investors or co-op members, etc.</li>

<li>Premises-related documentation, such as a lease or deed, diagrams, power, pest, or waste management</li>

<li>Water-related documentation, from rainwater catchment to wells to water quality permits</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of deficiencies for Owner applications may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fingerprint application, Government ID, or other deficiencies</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll receive a Deficiency notice in the form of a License Application Amendment or Owner Application Amendment. Your application will show a status of Additional Information Needed. Look for these deficiency amendments in your My Licenses list.</p>
