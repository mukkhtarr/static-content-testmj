<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a>Important Note Regarding Email Addresses</a></h3>

<p>Each person is uniquely identified by an <strong><u>email address and name</u></strong> in the licensing system.<br><strong><u>Enter this information carefully and accurately</u>. </strong>Errors will greatly slow your application.</p>

<ul>
<li>One person, one email address – do not use multiple email addresses for the same person.</li>

<li>Name fields are case sensitive – enter upper and lower case consistently and avoid using all caps or all lower-case.</li>

<li>When creating an account, there are two places to enter your email address – be sure it is the same email address for both entries.</li>

<li>All Owners must have separate email addresses – one person, one email address, even for partners, married couples, or people in the same household.</li>

<li>Do not use parentheses or other special characters in name fields – apostrophes, hyphens, and periods are acceptable to use. Disable your browser’s pop-up blocker – pop-up dialogs are used often in the system.</li>

<li>Do not use the <strong>Backspace</strong> key or the <strong>Back</strong> function to avoid losing work.</li>

<li></li>

<li>Use the <strong>Tab</strong> key to move from one field to the next – it also jumps to other objects such as <strong>Help</strong> and <strong>calendar</strong> functions.</li>
</ul>
