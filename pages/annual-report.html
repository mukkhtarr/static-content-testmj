<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Executive Summary </h2>

<p>Business and Professions Code section 26190 established annual reporting requirements for the Department of Cannabis Control (Department).

Finally, the enclosed report includes the Department’s responses pursuant to the Budget Act of 2022, under the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Item 1115-102-0001, which requires, beginning in 2023, and until 2026, the Department to provide a report on the Cannabis Local Jurisdiction Retail Access Grant Program.</p>

<p>As required by section 26190 of the Business and Professions Code and Item 1115-102-0001 of the Budget Act of 2022, the Department submits the following information regarding its activities. This report contains the required information and data for the prior fiscal year, July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Funds allocated </h2>

</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Licenses issued, renewed, denied, suspended, and revoked</h2>

<p>The number of state licenses issued, renewed, denied, suspended, and revoked by state license category. • </p>

<ul>
<li>Issued: 1,433 licenses</li>

<li>Renewed: 10,272 licenses</li>

<li>Denied: 0</li>

<li>Suspended: 12 licenses</li>

<li>Revoked: 1 license </li>
</ul>

<p>Please see Exhibit 1 for a breakdown by state license category.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Processing time</h2>

<p>The average time for processing state license applications by state license category. </p>

<ul>
<li>Cultivation Licenses: 258 days </li>

<li>Manufacturing Licenses: 190 days </li>

<li>Distribution Licenses: 215 days </li>

<li>Testing Laboratory Licenses: 964 days </li>

<li>Event Organizer Licenses: 96 days </li>

<li>Temporary Cannabis Event Licenses: 107 days </li>
</ul>

<p>The average times provided above are impacted by a number of external and internal factors, including, but not limited to: delays in responding to Department inquiries by applicants missing necessary documentation to meet annual license application requirements, verifying the accuracy of records submitted by applicants, and correspondence with other local and state entities to ensure compliance of statutory and regulatory requirements. Average licensing processing times are also impacted because many applicants do not produce all required documentation in a timely manner, creating significant delays in the application process. These factors, as well as a host of other factors, can impact the time it takes to approve a license. The Department notes that the processing of a backlog of over 6,000 applications from the previous reporting period (July 12, 2021 – June 30, 2022) also impacted processing times during this reporting period. </p>

<p>Testing laboratory applications are a notable outlier given the complexity of the license review process due to the requirement for a testing laboratory to submit complete standard operating procedures and method validations that meet regulatory testing standards. *Please see Exhibit 2 for a breakdown by state license category. </p>
