<p>As you can see, they are two completely different editors for creating content in WordPress.</p>

<p>The old classic editor was a text editor with formatting buttons similar to Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>The new editor uses a different approach, called ‘Blocks’ (hence, the name Block Editor).</p>

<p>Blocks are content elements that you can add to the edit screen to create layouts. Each item you add to your post or page is a block.</p>

<p>For example, you can add blocks for paragraphs, images, videos, galleries, audio, lists, and more. There are blocks for all common content elements, and more can be added by  <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">a really really long link that I want to not break into different lines</a>.</p>
