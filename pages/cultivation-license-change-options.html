</ul>

<p>If you are considering making any of these license changes, please review the information on this page, including the newly adopted regulations and definitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New regulations and definitions</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DCC has adopted emergency regulations to implement Senate Bill 833, codified in <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;sectionNum=26061.5." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business and Professions Code section 26061.5</a>.&nbsp; The emergency regulations include several new definitions that may be useful to licensees considering one or more of the license changes made available due to the implementation of Senate Bill 833.&nbsp; The following definitions are used throughout these FAQS and have been included in this section for quick reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>“Original Cultivation License” means the provisional or annual cultivation license type indicated on the license prior to any reduction in size pursuant to this section.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>“Reduced-Size Cultivation License” means a cultivation license type specified by the cultivation licensee that satisfies both of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>(A) The maximum canopy size of the cultivation license is smaller than the maximum canopy size allowed by the cultivation licensee’s Original Cultivation License.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(B) The cultivation license uses the same type of lighting (i.e., Indoor, Outdoor, Mixed Light Tier 1, or Mixed-Light Tier 2) as the Original Cultivation License&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>“Modified License Term” means the period of time that falls between submission of a cultivation licensee’s request to modify a license date of renewal and the requested modified license renewal date.&nbsp;</li>

<li>“Prorated Daily License Fee” means the prorated license fee for one calendar day, which shall be calculated by dividing the applicable annual license fee by 365. The applicable annual license fee shall be the license fee required by section 15014, section 15014.2, or section 15020.1(d)(2).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do I need to know about requesting a one-time change to my license expiration date?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Licensees with a processor, nursery, or cultivation license can now request a one-time change to their license expiration date.&nbsp; To qualify for a one-time change to a license expiration date, the following requirements must be met:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The eligible license must be valid,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>The licensee must select a new expiration date that is on or up to twelve months after the date of request,&nbsp;</li>

<li>The licensee must pay any applicable license fee, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>The licensee must meet all applicable renewal requirements for the license type.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible licensees can submit a request to make one-time change to their license expiration date during license renewal or at any time while the license is valid using the Cannabis Licensing System (CLS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have questions about making a one-time change to your license expiration date, please contact <a href="mailto:info@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">info@cannabis.ca.gov</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What do I need to know about placing my cultivation license in limited operations status?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cultivation licensees may now place a cultivation license in Limited Operations Status.&nbsp; Limited Operations Status can be selected during license renewal or when requesting a one-time change to the license expiration date.&nbsp; To qualify for Limited Operations Status, the licensee must pay any applicable licensing fee and meet all applicable license renewal requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Licensees with licenses in Limited Operations Status are prohibited from having mature plants on their premises and must destroy any mature plants not harvested before the date the license was placed in Limited Operations Status within 30 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Limited Operations Status allows a cultivation licensee to conduct the following activities:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Process and sell cannabis harvested before entering Limited Operations Status, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Possess and maintain seeds and immature plants used solely for propagation to preserve the genetic lineage of the licensee’s cannabis plants.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>A cultivation license placed in Limited Operations Status must remain In Limited Operations Status for the duration of the Modified License Term.&nbsp; The licensee may opt to return the license to active status at time of renewal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have questions about Limited Operations Status, please contact <a href="mailto:info@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">info@cannabis.ca.gov</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What do I need to know about reducing the canopy size of my cultivation license?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Licensees with an active cultivation license can now request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License either at the time of renewal or when making a one-time change to the cultivation license’s expiration date.&nbsp; To qualify for a Reduced-Size Cultivation License the licensee must:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit an updated premises diagram that satisfies regulatory requirements and identifies both the canopy area of the Original Cultivation License and the canopy area of the requested Reduced-Size Cultivation License,&nbsp;</li>

<li>Pay any applicable licensing fee, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>Meet all applicable renewal requirements.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, the following requirements apply to Reduced-Size Cultivation Licenses:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The reduced-size canopy area must be fully located with the canopy area of the Original Cultivation License,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Reduced-Size Cultivation License must maintain the same type of lighting as the Original Cultivation License, and&nbsp;</li>

<li>The Reduced-Size Cultivation License must remain at the reduced-size for the duration of the Modified License Term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>At the time of renewal, the licensee may choose to retain the Reduced-Size Cultivation License, change to a different Reduced-Size Cultivation License, or restore the Original Cultivation License.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will license fees be calculated when I place my cultivation license in Limited Operations Status at time of renewal?</strong><strong><s>&nbsp;</s></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When placing a cultivation license in Limited Operations Status at time of renewal, the licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Original Cultivation License plus 20% of the Original Cultivation License fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Example Scenario – A licensee that places a specialty cottage outdoor license In Limited Operations Status, at time of renewal, will be required to pay the $135.00 application fee plus 20% of the $1,205.00 annual license fee, which equals a modified license fee of $241.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calculation formula – $1,205.00 Original Cultivation License fee x 20% = $241.00 modified license fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have questions about calculating a modified license fee, please contact <a href="mailto:payments@cannabis.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payments@cannabis.ca.gov</a> for assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will license fees be calculated when I reduce the size of my cultivation license at time of renewal?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When reducing the size of a cultivation license at time of renewal, the licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Original Cultivation License plus the annual license fee associated with the Reduced-Size Cultivation License selected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Example scenario – A licensee with a Medium Indoor license, chooses to reduce the size of the license at renewal to a Small Indoor license.&nbsp; The licensee will be responsible for paying the application fee associated with the Medium Indoor license, which is $8,655, plus the annual license fee associated with the Small Indoor license, which is $35.410.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will license fees be calculated when I make a one-time change to my license expiration date?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a licensee with a valid processor, nursery, or cultivation license makes a one-time change to the license expiration date, DCC will calculate any credit the licensee is eligible for using a Prorated Daily License Fee.&nbsp; The credited amount will be automatically applied toward the license fee associated with the Modified License Term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Example scenario – A licensee renewed their processor license on October 1, 2023.&nbsp; The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually in February and submits a request to make a one-time change the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Here are the steps to calculate the license fee:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="1">
<li>Calculate the Prorated Daily License Fee by dividing the original license fee by 365 days in a year.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $9,370 annual processor license fee, divided by 365 days year equals a Prorated Daily License Fee of $25.67.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Calculate the number of days the licensee used the original processor license.&nbsp; This can be calculated by counting the number of days starting on October 1, 2023, and ending on May 1, 2024.&nbsp; Be sure to count all days including October 1, 2023, and May 1, 2024, which totals 241 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Calculate the amount of credit the license is eligible for by multiplying the number of days the original license was used (step 2) by the Prorated Daily Licensee Fee (step 1), then subtract the credit amount from the cost of the annual processor license.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculation formula – 241 days (step 2) x $25.67 Daily Prorated License Fee (step 1) = $6,186.47 credit.&nbsp; Next subtract the $6,187.47 credit from the cost of an annual processor license &#8211; $9,370.00 minus $6,186.47 = $3,183.53 in credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Calculate the cost of the modified license fee by subtracting the credit (step 3) from the cost of an annual processor license fee.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $9,370.00 minus $3,183.53 in credit = $6,184.47 modified license fee amount.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will license fees be calculated when I place my cultivation license in Limited Operations Status or request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License while making a one-time change to my license expiration date?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a licensee with valid cultivation license makes a one-time change to the license expiration date, DCC will calculate any credit the licensee is eligible for using a Prorated Daily License Fee.&nbsp; When requesting the one-time change to the license expiration date, a cultivation license may also request to place the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status or request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License. The credited amount will be automatically applied toward the license fee associated with the Modified License Term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Example scenario – A licensee renewed their Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 license on October 1, 2023.&nbsp; The licensee would prefer to renew their license annually in February and submits a request to make a one-time change the license’s expiration date, on May 1, 2024.&nbsp; The cultivation licensee would also like to either place the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status or request a Reduced-Size Cultivation License and decides to calculate both fee options to inform their decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Here are the steps to calculate the license fee:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="1">
<li>Calculate the Prorated Daily License Fee by dividing the original license fee by 365 days in a year.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculation formula &#8211; $25,970.00 annual Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 fee, divided by 365 days year equals a Prorated Daily License Fee of $71.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Calculate the number of days the licensee used the Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 license.&nbsp; This can be determined by counting the number of days starting on October 1, 2023, and ending on May 1, 2024, when the one-time change request was submitted to DCC.&nbsp; Be sure to count all days including October 1, 2023, and May 1, 2024, which totals 241 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Calculate the amount of credit by multiplying the number of days the Original Cultivation License was used (step 2) by the Prorated Daily Licensee Fee (step 1), then subtract this amount from the cost of the annual Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 license.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Calculation formula – 241 days (step 2) x $71.15 Prorated Daily Licensee Fee (step 1) = $17,147.15.&nbsp; Next subtract this amount from the cost of the annual Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 license.&nbsp; $25,970.00 annual Medium Mixed-Light Tier 1 license fee, minus $17,147.15 = $8,822.85 in credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Calculate the cost of the modified license fee by subtracting the credit (step 3) from the cost of placing the cultivation license in Limited Operations Status or requesting a Reduced-Size Cultivation License.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Selecting Limited Operations Status requires the licensee to pay 20% of the license fee associated with the Original Cultivation License, or $5,194.00 ($25,970.00 x 20%).&nbsp; In this example, the licensee has a credit of $8,822.85 and a modified license fee of $5,194.00.&nbsp; If the license chooses to place the license in Limited Operations Status, the license would be eligible for a credit of $3,628.85 ($8,822.85 credit minus $5,194.00 modified license fee = $3,628.85 credit).&nbsp;</li>

<li>Selecting a Reduced-Size Cultivation License requires the licensee to pay the annual licensing fee associated with the reduced-size license selected.&nbsp; In this scenario the licensee is considering cultivating 2,500 square feet of their canopy which means they would be required to pay for a Specialty Cottage Mixed-Light Tier 1 license, or $3,035.00.&nbsp; If the licensee decides to cultivate the area associated with a Specialty Cottage Mixed-Light Tier 1 license, the licensee would be eligible for a credit of $5,194.00 ($8,822.85 credit minus $3,035.00 Specialty Cottage Mixed-Light Tier 1 license fee = $5,194.00 credit).&nbsp;</li>
